# ![Liberty Project](./vue/static/logotip.png)

> This project has been developed for educational reasons for the application of final module 2ºDAW.

Project demo is available at http://colegioabogadosliberty.tk/#/

We use **Vue.js** for the frontend and **Odoo 10** for the backend.

## Short Description

This application deals with users, lawyers, clients and associations that are related to each other. It serves for bar associations or law firms where users can manage their work, client users can make queries through a forum in exchange for an amount and the lawyer will answer them in exchange for an economic reward. The client users will be able to comment on the opinions of the lawyers, in this way, any client will be able to know the work that they have done previously with their clients. Association users can ask for social help from a lawyer and they can subscribe to the association. The association may choose the lawyer that suits you best. Once the lawyer is chosen, he will have his recognition in the profile. The idea of ​​the forum or consultancy is to speed up the consultations of the client user.

## Getting started

The stack is built using [vue-cli webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) so to get started all you have to do is:

``` bash
# install dependencies
> yarn install or npm install
# frontend serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
> yarn serve or npm run serve
```

Other commands available are:

``` bash
# run unit tests
yarn run test:unit or npm run test:unit

# production
npm run build

```

To install Odoo you have to download version 10, so you will have to download the source code in github:

``` bash
# Download Odoo 10
git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git -b 10.0

```
Then you will have to install postgresql and install the dependencies. A good way to get started in Odoo is by starting here :

After all this, we will start by default in odoo on port 8069.
